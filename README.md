# Tic-Tac-Toe Minimax AI Algorithm

## Overview
In this project, we combine the concepts of minimax and evaluation functions to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game that plays a perfect game. We'll implement various scenarios, each employing different strategies of complexity, including random moves, two human players, and an unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm. The goal was to provide an easy-to-use application interface that allows players to challenge each other or the AI.

## Features
- **Three Game Modes:**
     - **Random Moves Scenario:** Start with a simple scenario where the game makes random moves.
     - **Two Human Players:** Enable players to play against each other.
     - **Unbeatable AI (Minimax Algorithm):** Implement an AI opponent that plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm.
       
- **Player Customization:** Choose the player to begin, enter player names, choose player icons, and number of rounds to play.
- **Interactive Application Interface Developed using JavaFX**

## Getting Started
To start playing Tic-Tac-Toe with our AI algorithm, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the application.
3. Choose your preferred game mode.
4. Enjoy the game and have fun!

I hope you have a great time playing this Tic-Tac-Toe.
